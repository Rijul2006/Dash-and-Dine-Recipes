# Dash & Dine | Recipe Website

This is a responsive frontend project built to showcase traditional Indian recipes with a modern user interface. The goal of this project was to combine clean design with interactive elements to make cooking instructions easy to follow.

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Interactive Recipe Layout
* Used the **`<details>`** and **`<summary>`** tags to create a toggleable section for ingredients and procedures.
* This approach keeps the page organized and allows the user to focus on one specific step at a time.

### 2. Horizontal Image Gallery
* Created a sliding "train" of images at the top of the page using **CSS Flexbox** and the `overflow-x` property.
* Implemented **`scroll-behavior: smooth`** and **`scroll-snap-type`** to ensure a high-quality user experience where images click into place while scrolling.

### 3. Modern Styling & Hover Effects
* Applied **CSS Gradients** to the background to create a premium, high-contrast aesthetic.
* Added **CSS Transitions** and **Transform** properties so that recipe cards scale up slightly when hovered, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

### 4. Responsive Design
* Used **CSS Media Queries** to ensure the website is fully functional on mobile devices.
* Optimized the navigation bar and content cards to stack vertically on smaller screens, maintaining readability and layout integrity.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For semantic page structure and interactive tags.
* **CSS3:** For custom animations, gradients, and responsive layouts.
* **Flexbox:** Used for overall alignment, the navigation bar, and the image slider.
