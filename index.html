                <li>1 cup Milk Powder (or grated Khoya/Paneer)</li>
                <li>¼ cup All-Purpose Flour (Maida)</li>
                <li>½ tsp Baking Powder or Baking Soda</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Ghee (melted) or Oil</li>
                <li>2-3 tbsp Milk (or yogurt/cream)</li>
                <li>1 cup Sugar</li>

                <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:Combine sugar, water, and crushed cardamom in a saucepan.
                 Boil until the sugar dissolves and the syrup thickens slightly (a one-string consistency).
                 Add rose water (if using) and set aside to cool slightly. </li>
                <li>Make the Dough:In a bowl, mix milk powder, flour, baking powder/soda, and salt (if using).
                 Add melted ghee and rub into the dry mix to get a breadcrumb-like texture.
                 Gradually add milk (or yogurt/cream) and gently mix to form a soft, smooth, lump-free dough. Do not over-knead.Cover and let the dough rest for 10-20 minutes. </li>
                <li>Shape the Jamuns:Knead the dough lightly again and divide it into small, equal portions.
                 Roll each portion into a smooth, crack-free ball between your palms.</li>

        <details><summary>Ingredients:</summary>
               <p>
                <ul>
                <li>2 cups full-fat milk powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), plus extra for greasing</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>6 to 8 tablespoons powdered sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sliced almonds and pistachios for garnish</li>
                
               </ul>
            </p>  
        </details>
        <details><summary>Procedure:</summary>
               <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Pan: Grease a square or rectangular dish with a little ghee or line it with parchment paper. Keep it ready, as the mixture sets quickly.In a heavy-bottomed, non-stick pan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee and the whole milk over a low flame. </li>
                <li>Add Milk Powder: Slowly add the milk powder, stirring continuously with a whisk or spatula to prevent lumps from forming.Increase the heat to medium-low and continue stirring non-stop until the mixture begins to thicken. This should take about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the remaining tablespoon of ghee, and mix well. Continue stirring until the mixture comes together as a non-sticky dough or mass and starts leaving the sides of the pan.</li>
                <li>Cool and Test: Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool completely. To test the consistency, grease your fingers and try rolling a small portion into a ball; it should be soft but not sticky. If it is still sticky, cook for another 2-3 minutes on a low flame. Once the mixture is completely cool, mix in the powdered sugar and cardamom powder.</li>
                <li>Set the Barfi: Transfer the mixture onto the greased tray or parchment paper. Use a spatula to spread it evenly and flatten the surface. Sprinkle the chopped almonds and pistachios over the top and gently press them into the mixture with a spatula. Let the barfi set at room temperature for 1-2 hours until firm.Once set, cut the barfi into squares or diamond shapes. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days or refrigerate for up to two weeks. .</li>
